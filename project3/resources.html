                        <h1>About the Project</h1>
                        <p>
                                        My project is based on the Game of chess. In this project basically I have tried covering
                                        some important topics related to the chess like the history, rules, and top 5 Champions till date.
                                        I have added the navigation bar at the top which is fixed and is rendered on all the pages,
                                        The components of the navigation bar are logo, links to the other page and a toggle button which appears
                                        when we decrease the size of the screen. The toggle button is used to switch between the nav-options.
                                        I have added videos on two pages related to content displayed on that page. I have used javascript to build 
                                        the toggle effect. The javascript file is placed in the assets directory.
                                        I have added a rollover effect to all the images where when we hover over the image it cretes a box-shaddow 
                                        effect.
                                        
                                        
                                        Very first the index page is displayed which contains 6 types of buutons to navigate between different pages.
                                        the button below the header "World of chess" will take you to the first introductory page i.e the history page.
                                        We cam even use the formal navigation atop of the page to glide between pages. If we click on the logo it takes us back 
                                        to the index page.
                                        
                                        When we go for the mobile view the nav-links gets disappeared and a icon is displayed oon the left side of the page.
                                        This icon can be used to toggle between navigation bar. This functionality is gained using the javascript in the background.
                                        I have mentioned the Resources I have used below.
