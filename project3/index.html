            <h1>Origins of the game</h1>
            <p>
                Chess, as we know it today, was born out of the Indian game chaturanga before the 600s AD.
                The game unfold throughout Asia and Europe over the approaching centuries, and eventually evolved into what we know as chess around the 16th century.
                One of the first masters of the game was a Spanish priest named Ruy Lopez. Although he didn't invent the opening named after him, he analyzed it in a book he published in 1561.
                Chess theory was thus primitive earlier that Lopez advocated the strategy of twiddling with the sun in your opponent's eyes
