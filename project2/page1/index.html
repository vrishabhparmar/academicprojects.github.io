            <h1>Internet</h1>
            <p>Internet is a technology which enables a user to connect world-wide with others and
                 helps the exchange of resources and information.
                A single person can’t be credit for inventing such a huge technology. It is a contribution from dozens of scientist, programmers, 
                and engineers all around the world feeding information, testing, and helping it to expand.  
                The first working design was introduced in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET( i.e Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). This project was funded by the U.S Department of Defence. 
                ARPANET used packet switching to allow the exchange of information between multiple workstations or users on a single network. After the invention of TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol) standards were set for how to transmit information or data between multiple networks.
                
                From January 1 ARPANET started introducing TCP/IP and from here onwards the creation of the huge network what we 
                call today as Internet began to assemble.   
                <br>
                <br>
                On October 29th, 1969, the first message was sent from computer to computer on ARPANET.
                

                In the year 1971, Ray Tomlinson devised electronic mail by creating the ARPANET email system. This concept became so successful that it started spreading everywhere around. Later ‘@’ was introduced which enables to set the destination of the particular server or computer.
                
                The “@” symbol, was one of the most biggest contribution to the Internet. 

                To set destination for a message to be transferred  became as simple as addressing it: “username@name of computer”.
                
                In the early days, internet was in the form of telnet which consisted of FTP, crude email programs , and news reading. Telnet made library catalogs, online services for users of that time, and news bulletin although not that user friendly like todays.

                By about 1990, information on the internet was expanding rapidly enough that it needed more organization and a better search capability. In 1991 researchers at the University of Minnesota developed the Gopher protocol in an attempt to provide some of that organization. 
                Gopher provides a hierarchical text-based menu system to organize the contents of a data repository

            <h1>World Wide Web</h1>
            <p>
                Storing huge chunks of information in a universal container which can be accessed from 
                everywhere had always been people's dreams. A collection that can create links between resources and provide us with the most desired information which we require at that time. One of the most famous systems which fulfill all the requirements is the World Wide Web (WWW). It is officially termed as "wide-area hypermedia information 
                retrieval initiative aiming to universal access to a large universe of data" 

               
                 <br>

                 World wide web was a successful project because CERN has been encouraging 
                 collaboration by academic and commercial parties since the onset of the project, 
                 and by doing so it got millions of people involved in the growth of the Web 
                 and furthermore, the simplicity of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), used 
                 for creating interactive documents, allowed these users to contribute to the expanding 
                 database of documents on the Web 
                 The World-Wide Web began in March 1989 at CERN. 
                <br>
                <br>
                CERN possessed both the financial and computing resources necessary to start the project. 
                In the original proposalTC1 Berners-Lee outlined two phases of the project:
                <ul class="content-list">
                    <li class="points">
                        <p>First, CERN would “make use of existing software and hardware as well as implementing simple browsers for the user’s workstations, based on an analysis of the requirements for information access needs by experiments.”</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="points">
                        <p>Second, they would “extend the application area by also allowing the users to add new material.”</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h1>Is there any difference between Web and Internet...?  </h1>
            
            <h2>Yes, there is a difference.</h2>
            <h3>Internet is a global network while the World Wide Web is a collection of information which can 
                be accessed via Internet. Alternatively, the Internet can be seen has a huge book-store while 
                the Web is a collection of the books in that book-store.
